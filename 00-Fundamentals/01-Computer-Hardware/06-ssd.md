#  Solid State Disks (SSD)

* SSDs are modern storage devices with **no moving parts**.
* Traditional hard disks use **spinning platters and read/write heads**.
* SSDs work like **large USB flash drives**, using memory chips.


### How SSDs Work

* Data is stored in **memory cells**, not on spinning disks.
* An **onboard controller** manages how data is written and read.
* Access time is much faster than traditional hard drives.


### Advantages of SSD

* Faster system **boot time**.
* Quicker **program loading**.
* Lower **power consumption**.
* Less **heat, noise, and vibration**.



### Disadvantages of SSD

* **More expensive** than traditional hard disks.
* Generally **lower capacity** for the price.
* Some SSDs are **soldered** to the motherboard and cannot be upgraded.
