10.1 `ls': List directory contents                                     
==================================  

    The `ls' program lists information about files (of any type, including directories).  Options and file arguments can be intermixed arbitrarily, as usual. 

    For non-option command-line arguments that are directories, by    
default `ls' lists the contents of directories, not recursively, and   
omitting files with names beginning with `.'.  For other non-option    
arguments, by default `ls' lists just the file name.  If no non-option 
argument is specified, `ls' operates on the current directory, acting  
as if it had been invoked with a single argument of `.'.                        
                                                                       
    By default, the output is sorted alphabetically, according to the  
locale settings in effect.(1) If standard output is a terminal, the    
output is in columns (sorted vertically) and control characters are    
output as question marks; otherwise, the output is listed one per line 
and control characters are output as-is.

 (1) If you use a non-POSIX locale (e.g., by setting `LC_ALL' to 
`en_US'), then `ls' may produce output that is sorted differently than
you're accustomed to.  In that case, set the `LC_ALL' environment     
variable to `C'.
