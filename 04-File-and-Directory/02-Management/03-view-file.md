Structure:
```bash
cat [OPTIONS] [FILE]
less [OPTIONS] FILE
more [OPTIONS] FILE
head [OPTIONS] [FILE]
tail [OPTIONS] [FILE]
head -n number_of_lines filename
tail -n number_of_lines filename
```

Examples:
```bash
cat alphabet.txt          # Display entire file
less alphabet.txt         # View file with scrolling 
more alphabet.txt         # View file with scrolling, older/limited version
head alphabet.txt         # Show first 10 lines by default
tail alphabet.txt         # Show last 10 lines by default
head -n 5 alphabet.txt    # Show first 5 lines of the file
tail -n 5 alphabet.txt    # Show last 5 lines of the file
```

## Command Line Pipes  ( `|` )

* `|` sends output of one command as input to another.
* Helps filter and refine large outputs.
* Commands run left → right; order matters.
* Multiple pipes can be chained.

**Examples:**

```bash
ls /etc | head               # show first 10 entries
ls /etc/ssh | nl             # number all lines
ls /etc/ssh | nl | tail -5   # number first, then show last 5
ls /etc/ssh | tail -5 | nl   # take last 5, then number 1–5
```

---
```bash
ls /etc/ssh | nl
```
* `ls /etc/ssh` → show files
* `|` → pass output
* `nl` → number each line

Example:

```text
1  ssh_config
2  ssh_config.d
3  sshd_config
```

Used to **count files** or **reference them by number**.
