# IP Addresses 

#### Key Points

* Hosts send network packets using **IP addresses**.
* Each packet includes:

  * **Destination IP** (receiver)
  * **Source IP** (sender)
* Two types of IP addresses exist : **IPv4** and **IPv6**


### IPv4 vs IPv6 

| Feature      | IPv4                       | IPv6                           |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Address Size | 32-bit                     | 128-bit                        |
| Format       | Decimal (e.g. 192.168.1.1) | Hexadecimal (e.g. 2001:db8::1) |
| Address Pool | Limited (~4.3 billion)     | Extremely large                |
| Adoption     | Widely used (98–99%)       | Limited usage                  |
| Features     | Basic                      | Advanced & efficient           |



### Why IPv6 Is Not Widely Used ?

* **NAT (Network Address Translation)**

  * Allows many devices to share one public IPv4 address.
  * Reduces urgency to migrate to IPv6.

* **Porting Challenges**

  * Requires updating systems, software, and infrastructure.
  * Global transition is complex and slow.
